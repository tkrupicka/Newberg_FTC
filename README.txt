This code is meant to provide a simple and clean teleop and autonomous for FTC robots using robotC. The main teleop file is "teleTK' and the main autonomous is "autoTK." This code was organized and written by Tyler K of Team 4586 in Newberg, Oregon, the original menu.h file was created by Matt Greensmith. Feel free to use it to better program, automate, and organize your robot's code. Acknowledgement is appreciated. 

The code is set up for a 6 wheeled robot with an encoder on the middle left wheel. It must be lightly edited to work on other platforms.

Additionally, the 4586 folder contains the code used to run the Tiger Team's final robot that competed in St. Louis in 2013 (senior year of high school). It used automated joints and presets to do most arm movement automatically. You can see how it worked here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNvRvfMIHuY&feature=youtu.be

Thanks!
